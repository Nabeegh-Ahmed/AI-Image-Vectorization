# AI-Image-Vectorization
A proof-of-concept to use K-Means Algorithm for Image Vectorization.

# Next Steps
1. Convert the Image into Frequency domain 
2. Separte beackground and foreground using high pass, band pass and low pass filters
3. Find a suitable number of number of centroids in K-Means
4. Apply K-Means to both the background and foreground
5. Recreate the Image
6. Apply Image Sharpening to make edges more prominent
